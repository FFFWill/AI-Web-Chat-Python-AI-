明月何皎皎，照我罗床帏。
忧愁不能寐，揽衣起徘徊。
客行虽云乐，不如早旋归。
出户独彷徨，愁思当告谁！
引领还入房，泪下沾裳衣。
”
AI回复: The bright, shining moon illuminates my chamber.  
I cannot sleep due to my melancholy; grasping the covers, I wander about.  
Though the journey may be filled with fun, it's better to return home early.  
Going out alone, feeling lonely and worried, who can I tell my thoughts to?  
When I lead myself back into the room, tears flow and soil my clothes.###RECORD_SEPARATOR###
